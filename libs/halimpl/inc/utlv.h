/**
 * @brief         Parse the TLV Buffer and find and update pEntry
 *
 * This utlity will traverse the pBuf, till bufLen. It will try
 * to search pEntry->tag from the pBuf.
 *
 * If pEntry->tag_type was Unknown, Once, it finds the expected
 * tag, it will update pEntry->tag_type And update
 * pEntry->tag_value.  pEntry->tag_value is a union, so it will
 * update required entry.
 *
 * If pEntry->tag_type was known, and there's a mismatch in the
 * found entry, this API would fail.
 *
 * If pEntry->tag_type was AU8 (Array of uint8_t), there are two
 * possibilites...
 *
 * AU8 No memcopy:
 *
 * - As in input, pEntry->au8.ptr is NULL
 * - Just point pEntry->au8.ptr to the existing location inside
 *   pBuf (No need to memcpy), and update pEntry->au8.outLen to
 *   lenght that we found.
 *
 * AU8 Copy Buffer:
 *
 * - As in input, pEntry->au8.ptr points to a valid buffer
 * - As in input, pEntry->au8.inMaxLen is maximum buffer as
 *   pointed by ptr
 * - Once found, the cotnets is copied to pEntry->au8.ptr, and
 *   pEntry->au8.outLen is update to the length that we found.
 *
 * @param[in]     pBuf    The buffer that has TLV or sequece of TLVs
 * @param[in]     bufLen  The buffer length
 * @param[in,out] pEntry  The entry.
 *
 * @return        The utlv status. See description of utlv_status_t
